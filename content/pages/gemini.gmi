# GEMINI

What is Gemini? I think DT from DistroTube explains it well:

=> gemini://distro.tube distro.tube

## WHY GEMINI?

I have decided to move my personal websites -- and some other projects -- over to the Gemini protocol for a number of reasons (in no specific order):

* Gemini-based capsules are easy to maintain
* Gemini-based capsules are fun to maintain!
* No tracking, ads, or any other uneeded fluff
* The community: From the short experience I have had with the Gemini community, it has been awesome! I love to see the motivation and movement behind this project, it's really inspiring!
* The development-sphere
